The distance of a pair of integers a and b is defined as the absolute difference between a and b.

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth smallest distance among all the pairs nums[i] and nums[j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,6,1], k = 3
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
2 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= 106
1 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2
```
Solution:
``` c++
/*** 
We will use a sliding window approach to count the number of pairs with distance <= guess.

For every possible right, we maintain the loop invariant: left is the smallest value such that nums[right] - nums[left] <= guess. Then, the number of pairs with right as it's right-most endpoint is right - left, and we add all of these up.

        int n = nums.size();

        sort(begin(nums), end(nums)); //

        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.back() - nums.front() + 1; // beats 91%.  we can also r = 1000001 instead, but it's only beats 22%.

        while(l < r){

            int mid = l + (r - l)/2;

            //cout << l << " " << r << " " << mid << endl; // common way to debug binary search algorithms.

            int i = 0, j = 1, cnt = 0;

            while(j < n){    // sliding windows

                while(i < j && nums[j] - nums[i] > mid) i++; 

                cnt += j - i; // cnt indicates the number of pairs whose (distance <= mid)

                j++;
            }

            if(cnt < k) l = mid + 1; //if cnt < k, we need to increase the distance.
            else r = mid;
        }

        return l;
    }
